1. Consider the leftmost and righmost appearances of some value in an array.
        We'll say that the "span" is the number of elements between the two inclusive. A single value has a span of 1.
        Returns the largest span found in the given array. (Efficiency is not a priority.)

        maxSpan([1, 2, 1, 1, 3]) → 4
        maxSpan([1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 1, 4]) → 6
        maxSpan([1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 4, 4]) → 6

Answer:-
public int maxSpan(int[] nums) {
  int span = 0;
  int tmp = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < nums.length; j++) {
      if (nums[i] == nums[j]) {
        tmp = j-i+1;
        span = Math.max(tmp,span);
      }
    }
  }
  return span;
